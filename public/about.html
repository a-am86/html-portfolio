<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I'm Adrien, a future web developer based in Switzerland. With a background in tourism management and several years of experience in customer service, I'm now diving into the world of web development to build useful, user-friendly, and modern websites.
</p>

<p> 
  I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I love the process of creating things from scratch. I'm curious, calm under pressure, and always eager to learn something new â€” whether it's solving a coding problem or improving user experience.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of tech, I'm passionate about travel, marketing, and tennis. I'm excited to combine my previous experiences with new skills to become a creative and reliable developer.
